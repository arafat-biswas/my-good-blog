            Israel’s Strategic Options regarding Iran.

            <SEction>
                <P>For over a year, Israel has been defending itself on seven fronts in a war launched by Iran and its proxies. This effort has led to Iran losing on three fronts that it constructed around Israel – Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria. From four other fronts – Yemen, Iraq, the West Bank and Iran itself – Iranian attacks are ongoing.</P>
                <P>
                    During this time, the Israel Defense Forces severely damaged two of Iran’s primary proxy terror armies, Hamas and Hezbollah, which were designed to help surround Israel with a ring of firepower. In recent months, Israel traded blows directly with Iran twice, leaving it essentially without air defenses, and its missile production program significantly damaged.
                </P>
                <P>As a direct domino effect from the damage Israel caused to the Iranian-led axis, and especially to Iran’s flagship proxy in Lebanon, Hizbullah, Sunni rebels in Syria identified a chance to launch a surprise offensive, resulting in the collapse of the Assad regime. Neither Iran nor Hizbullah were able to come to Assad’s aid, and the Syrian regime, a key pillar of the Iranian proxy program, fell apart in eleven days. Iran has seen its ring of fire around Israel collapse, and its vision for regional hegemony crumble.</P>
